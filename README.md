GraphQL basic project with fake backend

This project shows books in the form of a list. And also gives the provision to add books. We use GraphQL in this process.

We use db.js and run it using this command `json-graphql-server db.js`
The entire process about this is described here: https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server
